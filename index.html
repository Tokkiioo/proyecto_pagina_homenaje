            <h3>Here's a time line of Michael Faraday life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1791</strong> - Born in Newington Butt, United Kingdom</li>
                <li><strong>1812</strong> - At the age of 20 and at the end of his apprenticeship, Faraday attended
                    lectures by the eminent English chemist Humphry Davy of the Royal Institution and the Royal Society,
                    and John Tatum, founder of the City Philosophical Society.</li>
                <li><strong>1821</strong> - Faraday married Sarah Barnard, They had no children. Also, built two devices
                    to produce what he called electromagnetic rotation (electric motor)</li>
                <li><strong>1831</strong> - Discovered electromagnetic induction and other experiments that are still
                    the basis of modern electromagnetic technology (Faraday's laws)</li>
                <li><strong>1832</strong> - The University of Oxford granted Faraday an honorary Doctor of Civil Law
                    degree</li>
                <li><strong>1839</strong> - Faraday suffered a nervous breakdown, but eventually returned to his
                    investigations into electromagnetism.</li>
                <li><strong>1845</strong> -
                    Discovered the Faraday effect (deviation of the plane of polarization of light as a result of a
                    magnetic field, when passing through a transparent material). It was the first known case of
                    interaction between magnetism and light.</li>
                <li><strong>1853-1856</strong> - Having provided a number of various service projects for the British
                    government, when asked by the government to advise on the production of chemical weapons for use in
                    the Crimean War. Faraday refused to participate, citing ethical reasons.</li>
                <li><strong>1867</strong> - Passed away in Hampton Court, England</li>
            </ul>
